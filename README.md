# 🐶 Sentient Dog Runner  

Run, jump, survive.  

You are a small sentient dog with big dreams, stuck in a world of endless obstacles.  

This game is my take on the classic offline dinosaur runner, but with more personality, smoother jumps, and a four-legged friend who actually runs on two feet.

## 🎮 How to Play  
- **Spacebar** (desktop) or **Tap anywhere** (mobile) to jump.  
- Avoid the obstacles — the longer you survive, the faster the world moves.  
- Your score climbs with every obstacle passed.  
- Miss a jump and it’s game over.

## 🌟 Highlights  
- Smooth jumping physics (longer airtime for those close calls).  
- Gradual speed curve that ramps up the tension.  
- Works on both desktop and mobile — no installs needed.  
- Quick restarts, no page reloads.  
- Simple, clean design with a focus on play.
