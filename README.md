🐶 Sentient Dog Runner

Run, jump, survive.
You are a small sentient dog with big dreams, stuck in a world of endless obstacles.

This game is my take on the classic offline dinosaur runner — but with more personality, smoother jumps, and a four-legged friend who actually runs on two feet.

🎮 How to Play

• Spacebar (desktop) or Tap anywhere (mobile) to jump.

• Avoid the obstacles — the longer you survive, the faster the world moves.

• Your score climbs with every obstacle passed.

• Miss a jump and it’s game over.

🌟 Highlights
• Smooth jumping physics (longer airtime for those close calls).
• Gradual speed curve that ramps up the tension.
• Works on both desktop and mobile — no installs needed.
• Quick restarts, no page reloads.
• Simple, clean design with a focus on play.

🕹️ Play It
Just open the site in your browser and start running.
Tap anywhere on your phone screen or hit the spacebar to jump.
How far can you go before the world outruns you?
